# pandas

This is a website about giant pandas!

# interactive elements

- A mountain and cloud parallax! I used gsap ScrollTriggers to change the `top` values differently on scroll.
- A side-scrolling facts panel with random panda backgrounds. I again used ScrollTriggers to pin the panel and change the x based on the scroll. I implemented the pictures by shuffling an array with the file numbers. Also, there's an easter egg where there's a 1 in 100 chance of getting cat pictures instead of pandas!
- A card stacking effect! I did this by using ScrollTriggers again (I love gsap) and pinning the section behind the section that's being scrolled.
- The panda you can interact with! The dialog paths are chosen randomly.
